# Stanford cs229

My self-study repo for Stanford CS229

There are actually three different classes:

- [CS229a](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs229a/) - The Coursera Andrew Ng class, and ...
- [CS229](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229)  - A version with more math and theory.
- [CS229T](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs229t/) - Even more math.

I've create 4 separate subdirectories. One for each class, and a separate directory for Coursera.

- [CS229a and Coursera](cs229a/README.md)
- [CS229](cs229/README.md)
- [CS229t](cs229t/README.md)
- [Coursera](coursera/README.md)
