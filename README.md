# Stanford cs229

My self-study repo for Stanford CS229

There are actually three different classes:

- CS229a - The Coursera Andrew Ng class, and ...
- CS229  - A version with more math and theory.
- CS229T - Even more math.

I've create 3 separate subdirectories, one for each class.

- [CS229a and Coursera](cs229a/README.md)
- [CS229](cs229/README.md)
- [CS229t](cs229t/README.md)
