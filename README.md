# cs229

My self-study repo for Stanford CS229

There are actually three different classes: CS229a, CS229, and CS229t

The Coursera Andrew Ng class.  CS229a

The actual Stanford class, which has more math and theory.

CS229T, which has a lot of math.

I've create 3 separate subdirectories, one for each class.
